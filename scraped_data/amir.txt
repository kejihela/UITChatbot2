ABOUT MYSELF
 My name is Amir Diya Ayoubi. I am 15 years old, and i'm half Nigerian and half Syrian. 
I was born in Plateu state but i grew up in kaduna, and now i live in Abuja.
I attend Nigerian Tulip International College (NTIC), where i am currently in SS3. 
My favorite hobbies are playing badminton, swimming, and sometimes just relaxing at home.
I also love the rain it makes me feel calm and peacful.
i'm someone who enjoys learning new things, especially in subjescts like mathematics,
computer studies, and science. In the future, i hope to study Data science because i
want to build solutions that can make life easier for people.
That's a little about me.
