When an emergency happens, every second counts—especially when it involves a child. Paediatric first aid is the immediate care given to babies and young children in medical emergencies, from minor injuries to life-threatening situations. Unlike general first aid, paediatric first aid is specifically tailored to the unique needs of infants and children, ensuring that parents, caregivers, and childcare professionals can respond effectively in critical moments.

Accidents can happen anytime—whether it’s a choking incident at mealtime, a fall at the playground, or an allergic reaction. Knowing what to do in these situations can mean the difference between a quick recovery and a serious medical emergency. That’s why paediatric first aid training is so important. It equips parents and caregivers with the essential skills to stay calm, act quickly, and provide potentially life-saving assistance when it’s needed most.

In this guide, we’ll explore what paediatric first aid involves, the key skills you’ll learn, and why it’s a must-have for anyone caring for young children.

Paediatric first aid is specifically designed to address medical emergencies involving babies and young children. Because children’s bodies are smaller and more delicate than adults, they require different techniques and approaches in emergency situations.

Below are some of the essential skills covered in a paediatric first aid course.
