Globally, infectious diseases, including pneumonia, diarrhoea, malaria and sepsis remain the leading causes of death for children 1 month to 9 years of age. Access to basic lifesaving interventions such as adequate nutrition, vaccinations, and treatment for common childhood diseases can save many young lives.

The CHD unit works with departments and units that are directly responsible for communicable conditions such as dengue, helminthic infections, HIV/AIDS, Â malaria, neglected tropical diseases and tuberculosis to make available guidelines and practical tools that include, or have an exclusive focus on, children. Furthermore, CHD works on integration of assessment, classification and treatment of communicable diseases in health service delivery, through the integrated management of childhood illness strategy and its tools that are regularly reviewed and updated in accordance with new guidelines.
